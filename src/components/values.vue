                    <p>
                        We love founders who have overcome long odds to get where they are today. Nothing is more authentic than the growth that comes from struggle. We invest in first time founders and proven ones.
                    </p>

                            <h4>Early stage</h4>
                            <p>
                                We typically first invest in Seed or Seed Extension rounds where we believe we can add the most value. We also selectively invest in Series A companies.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Hard Problems</h4>
                            <p>
                                We only invest in founders solving problems that, if solved, can create a tremendous amount of value for customers and stakeholders. Bold, ambitious visions are favored over modest ones.

                            <p>
                                Can you demonstrate that product market fit can be achieved on a modest amount of capital?

                            <p>
                                Weâ€™re particularly fond of AI/Machine Learning, Mobile, Cloud, Healthcare & Education. We love technology and especially software.

                            <h4>Technical background</h4>
                            <p>
                                Do you have two or more founders? And does at least one have a technical background? We rarely invest in teams that do not have at least one technical founder.

                            <p>
                                Trust, integrity, putting customers and stakeholders first, inclusion and honesty are all must haves.
