              <p>
                  Welcome to the Authentic Ventures website (including all subdomains, the “Site”), which is

                  Ventures,” “we”, “us” and/or “our”). This Site provides, among other things, information about
                  our people, organization, portfolio companies and their founders and tools for members to
                  engage in the Authentic Ventures’ Network. This Privacy Policy sets forth Authentic Venture’s
                  policy with respect to personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) and certain other

              </p>
              <p>
                  By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in
                  accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to us, you
                  acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current
                  location to the offices and servers of Authentic Ventures and the authorized third parties

                  <b>Non-Identifiable Data:</b> When you interact with Authentic Ventures through the Site, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information cannot presently be
                  used to specifically identify you. Authentic Ventures may store such information itself or such
                  information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Authentic Ventures
                  affiliates, agents or service providers. We may use such information and pool it with other
                  information to track, for example, the characteristics of businesses or individuals that engage
                  with Authentic Ventures or with our Authentic Ventures’ Network, and we may publish or
                  otherwise disclose such aggregated information.
              </p>

              <p>
                  <b>Aggregated Personal Data:</b> In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Site, Authentic Ventures may conduct research on the characteristics of such users, including but not limited to user demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Authentic Ventures, may publish or otherwise disclose such aggregated information. This aggregate information does not identify you personally.
              </p>

              <p>
                  <b>Analytics and Tracking Technologies:</b> We may, and we may allow third party service providers to, use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your use of the Site.

                  Our Site currently does not respond to “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals and operates as described in this Privacy Policy whether or not a DNT signal is received. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy.
